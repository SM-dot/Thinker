        very similar to the word ladder problem 
        basically this is a graph problem 
        how do we know that? 
        we have a starting state "0000" and need to reach an ending state "target number"
        we need to minimize this journey, aha BFS or level order traversal! 

        use deadends as a visited array, to check if in deadends convert it to set as lookup in set is O(1) time thus reducing time complexity .
