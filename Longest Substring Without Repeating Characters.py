class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        """
        Returns the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

        Approach:
        - Use the sliding window technique with two pointers (left and right).
        - Move the right pointer through the string, adding characters to a set.
        - If a duplicate character is found, move the left pointer forward until the duplicate is removed.
        - At each step, update the answer with the size of the current window (right - left + 1).
        
        Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the string.
        Space Complexity: O(min(n, m)), where m is the size of the character set (e.g., 26 for lowercase).
